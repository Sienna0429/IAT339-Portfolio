                    <h3>Project Background</h3>
                    <p>157 Moments is a fashion boutique located in Gastown, Vancouver, specializing in a curated
                        selection
                        of independent
                        designer brands from around the world. The
                        brand places a strong emphasis on in-store experiences, aiming to communicate its aesthetic and
                        philosophy through
                        meaningful offline interactions with customers.
                        The goal of this project was to enhance the in-store experience through interaction design,
                        fostering greater customer
                        engagement and emotional connection.</p>
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>I led communication with the store owner to align design goals and managed progress updates
                        throughout the project. I
                        conducted user interviews, on-site visits, and ethnographic observation to identify customer
                        pain
                        points, and designed
                        low-to-mid fidelity prototypes and final visual deliverables such as posters and concept
                        materials.
                        I also facilitated a
                        design workshop to validate our proposals with stakeholders.

                <div class="stage-discription">
                    <p>I conducted field research at 157 Moments over two visits in two weeks. Through a one-hour
                        semi-structured interview
                        with the store manager, we learned about the brand's values and in-store goals. We also held an
                        unstructured interview
                        with the co-owner and two staff members to uncover internal perspectives and identify design
                        focus areas. Additionally,
                        we carried out on-site observations at the Gastown location to explore the spatial experience
                        and study how customers
                        interacted with the store environment and staff.
                        These combined methods revealed key issues—such as limited product information and inconsistent
                        event participation.
                        More importantly, they exposed a lack of direct customer insight, which became a turning point
                        in refocusing the design
                        scope.</p>

                    <p>Using qualitative insights, I helped shape personas that highlighted the desire for meaningful

                        lightweight
                        interactions between staff and customers. I steered the team to deprioritize “brand awareness”
                        as it
                        leaned toward
                        marketing, and instead focused on issues that could be tackled with interaction design.</p>
                    <!-- <h4>Key decisions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To address the problem of limited product information, we planned to add information prompts to
                        reduce
                        customer confusion.</li>
                    <li>To encourage event engagement, we planned to create more meaningful connections among attendees
                        and
                        between customers and staff</li>
                    <li>We decided to drop the Low Brand Awareness concentration, because it leans more toward business
                        and
                        marketing strategy with limited space for interaction design.

                        Our main focus for this project is solving design problems, thus, this pain point didn't align
                        with
                        our
                        vision</li>

                    <h4>DIGITAL LOOK BOOK</h4>
                    <p>The Digital Look-book showcases curated styles that connect customers with the brand's identity.
                        By
                        picking up an iPad
                        from the tables, they can explore outfit inspirations, get inspired, and ask about specific
                        pieces.
                        Staff can help them
                        find matching items like bag, scarves or jewellery, making styling more personalised.</p>

                    <h4>PICK AND SEEK</h4>
                    <p>Pick & Seek makes shopping fun and interactive. Customers draw a card with a clue and search for
                        the
                        matching item in
                        the store. It's a game that encourages curiosity, discovery, and connection. When they find the
                        item, they can try it
                        on, style it, and take a Polaroid photo as a keepsake. It turns a regular shopping trip into a
                        playful, memorable
                        experience.</p>

            <!-- <div class="stage-discription">
                <p>I led the mapping of two key user types: Browsers and Event Participants. By analyzing their goals,
                    pain points, and
                    emotions across different stages, I identified actionable opportunities. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browsers struggled with unclear product narratives.</li>
                    <li>Event participants found activities passive and disengaging.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This process also taught me the importance of showing causal relationships between actions and
                    emotions in journey maps,
                    which shaped how we refined our concepts.</p> -->
            <!-- <h4>Key decisions</h4>
                <p>We have come up with more specific ideas to address the lack of information on products and the low
                    participation in
                    events.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide customers with more information, we could add price tag on each item or create a
                        brand story booklet to offer a richer narrative about the brand.</li>
                    <li>To enhence event partipation, we were considering to incorporate interactive sessions to
                        encourage social interaction</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Takeaway: <br>User journey mapping isn't a one-time process</h4>
                <p>Although actions, thoughts, and feelings are listed, their logical relationships and how they
                    influence each other are
                    not clearly shown, leading to a misalignment in design focus.</p> -->

        <h4 class="reflection-title">What have I learned?</h4>
        <div class="reflection">
            <p>
                Creating the user journey map helped me deeply empathize with the people I was designing for—not
                just as
                users, but as
                individuals with emotions, expectations, and unique points of friction.

                As a UX designer, I learned the importance of stepping outside assumptions and visualizing
                experiences
                from
                the user's
                perspective. Mapping out each stage of their interaction—from discovery to action—revealed hidden
                gaps,
                moments of
                hesitation, and missed opportunities for engagement.

                This process also taught me how to translate abstract feedback into design decisions, and how small
                design
                tweaks could
                influence how users feel at each step. Most importantly, it reminded me that great design isn't just
                about
                usability—it's about creating meaningful, emotionally resonant experiences.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Projet Takeaways</h2>
        <div class="takeaway">
            <p>
                Our workshop with the brand confirmed strong interest in interactive experiences that fit the store’s
                aesthetic
                and
                operational reality. This project deepened my understanding of the UX process, from exploratory research
                to
                synthesizing
                insights into actionable design. I developed stronger skills in:

                User-centered design thinking

                Communication with stakeholders

                Visual storytelling (e.g. storyboards, journey maps)

                Translating qualitative insights into design direction

                Most importantly, I learned to balance feasibility with creativity—ensuring that my design solutions are
                not
                only
                engaging, but also implementable in real-world settings.</p>
