                <h3>Project Background</h3>
                <p>157 Moments is a fashion boutique located in Gastown, Vancouver, specializing in a curated selection
                    of independent
                    designer brands from around the world. The
                    brand places a strong emphasis on in-store experiences, aiming to communicate its aesthetic and
                    philosophy through
                    meaningful offline interactions with customers.
                    The goal of this project was to enhance the in-store experience through interaction design,
                    fostering greater customer
                    engagement and emotional connection.</p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>I led communication with the store owner to align design goals and managed progress updates
                    throughout the project. I
                    conducted user interviews, on-site visits, and ethnographic observation to identify customer pain
                    points, and designed
                    low-to-mid fidelity prototypes and final visual deliverables such as posters and concept materials.
                    I also facilitated a
                    design workshop to validate our proposals with stakeholders.

            <p>I conducted in-depth interviews with the owner and staff, and observed multiple store events. While these
                helped us
                identify key issues—such as limited product information, inconsistent event participation, and low brand
                awareness—I
                recognized that direct customer data was lacking, which became a turning point in refocusing our design
                scope.</p>

                <p>Using qualitative insights, I helped shape personas that highlighted the desire for meaningful but
                    lightweight
                    interactions between staff and customers. I steered the team to deprioritize “brand awareness” as it
                    leaned toward
                    marketing, and instead focused on issues that could be tackled with interaction design.</p>
                <!-- <h4>Key decisions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To address the problem of limited product information, we planned to add information prompts to
                        reduce
                        customer confusion.</li>
                    <li>To encourage event engagement, we planned to create more meaningful connections among attendees
                        and
                        between customers and staff</li>
                    <li>We decided to drop the Low Brand Awareness concentration, because it leans more toward business
                        and
                        marketing strategy with limited space for interaction design.

                        Our main focus for this project is solving design problems, thus, this pain point didn't align
                        with
                        our
                        vision</li>

                <h4>DIGITAL LOOK BOOK</h4>
                <p>The Digital Look-book showcases curated styles that connect customers with the brand's identity. By
                    picking up an iPad
                    from the tables, they can explore outfit inspirations, get inspired, and ask about specific pieces.
                    Staff can help them
                    find matching items like bag, scarves or jewellery, making styling more personalised.</p>

                <h4>PICK AND SEEK</h4>
                <p>Pick & Seek makes shopping fun and interactive. Customers draw a card with a clue and search for the
                    matching item in
                    the store. It's a game that encourages curiosity, discovery, and connection. When they find the
                    item, they can try it
                    on, style it, and take a Polaroid photo as a keepsake. It turns a regular shopping trip into a
                    playful, memorable
                    experience.</p>

        <!-- <div class="stage-discription">
                <p>I led the mapping of two key user types: Browsers and Event Participants. By analyzing their goals,
                    pain points, and
                    emotions across different stages, I identified actionable opportunities. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browsers struggled with unclear product narratives.</li>
                    <li>Event participants found activities passive and disengaging.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This process also taught me the importance of showing causal relationships between actions and
                    emotions in journey maps,
                    which shaped how we refined our concepts.</p> -->
        <!-- <h4>Key decisions</h4>
                <p>We have come up with more specific ideas to address the lack of information on products and the low
                    participation in
                    events.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide customers with more information, we could add price tag on each item or create a
                        brand story booklet to offer a richer narrative about the brand.</li>
                    <li>To enhence event partipation, we were considering to incorporate interactive sessions to
                        encourage social interaction</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Takeaway: <br>User journey mapping isn't a one-time process</h4>
                <p>Although actions, thoughts, and feelings are listed, their logical relationships and how they
                    influence each other are
                    not clearly shown, leading to a misalignment in design focus.</p> -->

                    <li>
                        By creating a storyboard, we were able to map out the customer journey for each proposed
                        concept.
                        This process helped us
                        anticipate how customers might react to our concepts, ensuring that these ideas aligned with
                        their
                        expectations.

                        At first, we thought adding price tags would make product information clearer, but through
                        storyboarding, we realized
                        that constantly updating prices would be too much work for them. We'll look for a more
                        practical solution going forward.

        <p class="stage-5-description">We had a workshop with two of 157Moments' store staff to discuss the practical
            feasibility of the
            current
            ideas, identify Alternative Solutions to Overcome Potential Challenges, and explore more creative
            possibilities.</p>

                    the question: <br>"What

                <p>After introducing our three design concepts, we created a mind map to identify concerns and possible
                    solutions based on
                    participant feedback. We'd like to gain more valuable insights from their perspectives.</p>

                <h4>What We Gathered</h4>
                <h5>Employee Insights on Customer Behaviour</h5>
                <p>During the workshop, Nil and Ula shared their experiences interacting with customers in the store,
                    giving us a broader
                    perspective on how different customers react and think. For example, some might feel nervous about
                    starting a
                    conversation, while others may be too shy to try a perfume.</p>
                <h5>Design Considerations for Customer Engagement</h5>
                <p>The insights made us realise the importance of considering these behaviours in our design, such as
                    adding prompts to
                    encourage customers to engage with the staff. We also got some new ideas from the staff, such as
                    considering a more
                    engaging video format instead of a booklet.</p>

    <h3>Outcome & Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        Our workshop with the brand confirmed strong interest in interactive experiences that fit the store’s aesthetic
        and
        operational reality. This project deepened my understanding of the UX process, from exploratory research to
        synthesizing
        insights into actionable design. I developed stronger skills in:

        User-centered design thinking

        Communication with stakeholders

        Visual storytelling (e.g. storyboards, journey maps)

        Translating qualitative insights into design direction

        Most importantly, I learned to balance feasibility with creativity—ensuring that my design solutions are not
        only
        engaging, but also implementable in real-world settings.</p>
