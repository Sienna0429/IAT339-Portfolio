                <h3>Who is 157 Moments?</h3>
                <p>A fashion boutique located in Gastown, offering a carefully curated selection of unique items from
                    around the world,
                    ranging from women's clothing to perfumes and lifestyle products. They place great emphasis on the
                    in-store user
                    experience and offline interactions with customers.</p>
                <h3>Our Goal</h3>
                <p>Enhance users' in-store experience by redesigning the interaction model between users and the store.

            <p class="stage-number">01</p>
            <h3>Ethnography</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="stage-discription">
            <p>Through more in-depth interviews with them, participation in events, and observation of interactions
                during events, we
                narrowed down the broad goal of improving user experience into 3 specific concentrations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited Product Information</li>
                <li>Inconsistent Event Participation</li>
                <li>Low Brand Awareness</li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, since we didn't get enough data from the customers, we still lacked a deep understanding of the
                customer
                experience.</p>

                <h3>Persona</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-discription">
                <p>When analysing personas, we found that both staff and customers wanted more meaningful interactions
                    with each other, though, not way too much. <br>Since the current event process is not well
                    organised,
                    some consumers may feel confused and bored during the event. And the lack of sufficient product
                    information is indeed one of the key factors in the degradation of the customer
                    experience.</p>
                <h4>Key decisions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To address the problem of limited product information, we planned to add information prompts to
                        reduce
                        customer confusion.</li>
                    <li>To encourage event engagement, we planned to create more meaningful connections among attendees
                        and
                        between customers and staff</li>
                    <li>We decided to drop the Low Brand Awareness concentration, because it leans more toward business
                        and
                        marketing strategy with limited space for interaction design.

                        Our main focus for this project is solving design problems, thus, this pain point didn't align
                        with
                        our
                        vision</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>User Journey</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-discription">
                <p>By stepping into the perspectives of The Browser and Event Participants, we gained insight into their
                    experiences,
                    thoughts, and frustrations at different stages rather than making assumptions.<br>
                    We found that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Browser struggles with a lack of product information, making it difficult to understand
                        pricing
                        and brand
                        narratives.</li>
                    <li>Event Participants may feel disengaged due to a rigid event structure with limited opportunities
                        for
                        interaction.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Key decisions</h4>
                <p>We have come up with more specific ideas to address the lack of information on products and the low
                    participation in
                    events.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide customers with more information, we could add price tag on each item or create a
                        brand story booklet to offer a richer narrative about the brand.</li>
                    <li>To enhence event partipation, we were considering to incorporate interactive sessions to
                        encourage social interaction</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Takeaway: <br>User journey mapping isn't a one-time process</h4>
                <p>Although actions, thoughts, and feelings are listed, their logical relationships and how they
                    influence each other are
                    not clearly shown, leading to a misalignment in design focus.</p>

                        personal style with the
                        brand's essence. Customers can just walk into the store, pick up an item, go through the brand
                        look-book and get
                        inspired to style it!</p>

                        of
                        connection through
                        fragrance. By inviting customers to explore signature scents and record their impressions, the
                        book
                        becomes a collective
                        sensory journal. As people read others' reflections, they gain new perspectives on the same
                        scent,
                        turning fragrance
                        into a shared language that transcends individuality.</p>

                        different product
                        categories and featuring a descriptive clue. The challenge is to locate the corresponding item

                        the store, turning
                        shopping into an interactive treasure hunt. Those who successfully find the item can select an
                        outfit of their choice

                        that constantly updating prices would be too much work for them. We'll look for a more

                <h4>What We Gathered</h4>
                <h5>Employee Insights on Customer Behaviour</h5>
                <p>During the workshop, Nil and Ula shared their experiences interacting with customers in the store,
                    giving us a broader
                    perspective on how different customers react and think. For example, some might feel nervous about
                    starting a
                    conversation, while others may be too shy to try a perfume.</p>
                <h5>Design Considerations for Customer Engagement</h5>
                <p>The insights made us realise the importance of considering these behaviours in our design, such as
                    adding prompts to
                    encourage customers to engage with the staff. We also got some new ideas from the staff, such as
                    considering a more
                    engaging video format instead of a booklet.</p>
