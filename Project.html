                    <h3>Project Background</h3>
                    <p>157 Moments is a fashion boutique located in Gastown, Vancouver, specializing in a curated
                        selection
                        of independent
                        designer brands from around the world. The
                        brand places a strong emphasis on in-store experiences, aiming to communicate its aesthetic and
                        philosophy through
                        meaningful offline interactions with customers.
                        The goal of this project was to enhance the in-store experience through interaction design,
                        fostering greater customer
                        engagement and emotional connection.</p>
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>I led communication with the store owner to align design goals and managed progress updates
                        throughout the project. I
                        conducted user interviews, on-site visits, and ethnographic observation to identify customer
                        pain
                        points, and designed
                        low-to-mid fidelity prototypes and final visual deliverables such as posters and concept
                        materials.
                        I also facilitated a
                        design workshop to validate our proposals with stakeholders.

                    <p>I conducted field research at 157 Moments over two visits in two weeks. Through a one-hour
                        semi-structured interview
                        with the store manager, we learned about the brand's values and in-store goals. We also held an
                        unstructured interview
                        with the co-owner and two staff members to uncover internal perspectives and identify design
                        focus areas.</p>
                    <p>Additionally,
                        we carried out on-site observations at the Gastown location to explore the spatial experience
                        and study how customers
                        interacted with the store environment and staff.</p>

                <p>Using qualitative insights, I shaped personas that revealed the need for meaningful yet
                    lightweight staff-customer
                    interactions.</p>
                <p>Due to the limited customer data gathered during the ethnographic research phase, I categorized
                    customers into two key
                    groups—regular and new—to represent varying levels of brand familiarity and engagement. At the
                    same time, I incorporated
                    insights from store staff to provide an internal perspective on customer behavior.</p>
                <p>By synthesizing this qualitative input, I identified the goals, motivations, and frustrations of
                    each user group and
                    mapped out their differing needs. This analysis directly informed a unique design focus for each
                    persona, serving as a
                    foundation for ideation. These design foci helped ensure our proposed interactions were
                    empathetic, targeted, and
                    feasible within the store context.</p>
                <p>This process helped me build empathy for different user types and clarified how design could
                    support both customer
                    confidence and staff proactivity in a subtle, non-intrusive way.</p>

                    <h4>DIGITAL LOOK BOOK</h4>
                    <p>To address customers’ desire for more styling guidance and brand storytelling, the Digital
                        Look-book presents curated
                        outfit inspirations that reflect the brand's aesthetic. Customers can pick up an iPad from the
                        table to explore these
                        looks at their own pace. This allows them to better understand how to style individual pieces,
                        sparking ideas and
                        building confidence. When a particular style resonates with them, they can approach staff for
                        help locating matching
                        items like bags, scarves, or jewellery—fostering lightweight but meaningful interactions.</p>

                    <h4>PICK AND SEEK</h4>
                    <p>Pick & Seek turns shopping into an engaging, interactive experience. Customers draw a card with a
                        creative prompt—such
                        as “Find something that makes you feel confident”—and explore the store to find a matching item.
                        This gamified
                        experience encourages playful discovery and breaks down social barriers, creating more
                        opportunities for organic
                        staff-customer conversations. After styling their chosen item, customers can capture the moment
                        with a Polaroid photo,
                        leaving with both a look and a memory.</p>
                    <p>This concept responds to insights about the value of
                        customer participation, the
                        need for low-barrier conversation starters, and the importance of deepening product engagement.

            <h4 class="reflection-title">What have I learned?</h4>
            <p>
                Creating the user journey map helped me deeply empathize with the people I was designing for—not
                just as
                users, but as
                individuals with emotions, expectations, and unique points of friction.

                As a UX designer, I learned the importance of stepping outside assumptions and visualizing
                experiences
                from
                the user's
                perspective. Mapping out each stage of their interaction—from discovery to action—revealed hidden
                gaps,
                moments of
                hesitation, and missed opportunities for engagement.

                This process also taught me how to translate abstract feedback into design decisions, and how small
                design
                tweaks could
                influence how users feel at each step. Most importantly, it reminded me that great design isn't just
                about
                usability—it's about creating meaningful, emotionally resonant experiences.</p>

        <section class="takeaway">
            <h2 class="subtitle">Projet Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Through this project, I learned how to balance user needs with business constraints—an essential skill in
                real-world UX
                work. Engaging directly with store staff and observing in-person interactions revealed how powerful
                contextual research
                can be in shaping grounded and meaningful design directions.</p>
            <p>Our co-creation workshop validated the value of interactive experiences that not only align with the
                brand's aesthetic
                but also fit within their operational realities. This experience deepened my understanding of the full
                UX process—from
                exploratory research and insight synthesis to concept development and stakeholder validation.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project, I strengthened my skills in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>User-centered design thinking</li>
                <li>Stakeholder communication</li>
                <li>Visual storytelling (e.g., storyboards, journey maps)</li>
                <li>Translating qualitative insights into design decisions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most importantly, I learned how to bridge creativity with feasibility—ensuring that the solutions I
                propose are not just
                engaging and user-friendly, but also practical and implementable within the constraints of a real
                business.
